# UI Architecture for BudgetBuddy

## 3. User Journey Map

**Main Flow** â€“ The user registers or logs in, then manages their expenses:

1. The user visits the Landing Page (`/`) and selects the option to log in or register, navigating to `/auth`.
2. After authentication, the user is directed to the Dashboard (`/dashboard/expenses`), where they review their expense list and use filtering and sorting tools.
3. The user clicks the option to add an expense, which opens a modal for adding (or editing) an expense.
4. Using the action buttons in the table, the user edits or deletes an expense, with deletion requiring confirmation via a modal.
5. Within the dashboard, the user can open the AI chat to ask a question about their expense history.
6. The user navigates to the Categories (`/dashboard/categories`) or Sources (`/dashboard/sources`) management views to make modifications in these areas.
7. The global Top Bar provides the user access to profile options and logout.

## 4. Layout and Navigation Structure

- **Sidebar**: Visible for authenticated users, it contains links to the Dashboard, Categories Management, and Sources Management.
- **Top Bar**: A global element displayed on all pages after login; it includes the avatar, user's name, and an account options menu.
- **Modals**: Used for CRUD operations and AI chat integration, ensuring a consistent interface and allowing quick actions without a full page reload.
- **Routing**: The secure routing mechanism requires authentication, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login screen or Landing Page.

## 5. Key Components

- **Sidebar and Top Bar**: Navigation elements that offer quick access to the main views and features of the application.
- **Responsive Components**: Ensure compatibility with mobile and desktop devices and support for keyboard navigation (WCAG AA).
