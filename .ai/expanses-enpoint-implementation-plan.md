# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: POST /expenses

## 1. Endpoint Overview

The endpoint is used to create a new expense record assigned to the user. Upon successful creation, it returns the details of the newly created record; otherwise, it returns an appropriate error.

## 2. Request Details

- **HTTP Method:** POST
- **URL Structure:** `/expenses`
- **Request Body Parameters:**
  - **Required:**
    - `title` (string): The title of the expense; maximum 50 characters.
    - `date` (string, ISO): The date of the expense; must be in a valid ISO format.
    - `amount` (number): The amount of the expense; a numeric value with currency formatting.
  - **Optional:**
    - `description` (string): The description of the expense; maximum 200 characters.
    - `category_id` (string/number): The identifier of the category (associated with the user).
    - `source_id` (string/number): The identifier of the payment source.

## 3. Used Types

- **ExpenseDTO:** Definition of the expense from the database.
- **CreateExpenseCommand:** The command model for creating an expense; based on the insert type, excluding the `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields.

## 4. Response Details

- **Success (201):** Returns a JSON object containing the details of the newly created expense record, including its `id` and timestamps.
- **Errors:**
  - **400 Bad Request:** Incorrect input data (e.g., exceeding character limits, invalid format).
  - **401 Unauthorized:** The user is not authenticated.
  - **422 Unprocessable Entity:** Domain validation failed (e.g., invalid date or amount format).

## 5. Data Flow

1. The request is received with expense data in the request body.
2. User authentication is verified via Supabase (token verification, RLS check).
3. Input Data Validation:
   - Check the length of `title` (<= 50 characters) and `description` (<= 200 characters, if provided).
   - Verify that `date` is in a valid ISO format.
   - Validate that `amount` is a number with proper currency formatting.
4. Transform the input data into the `CreateExpenseCommand` format.
5. (Optional) Verify that the provided `category_id` and `source_id` correspond to records associated with the user.
6. Create a new expense record in the `expense` table using Supabase.
7. Return a response with the data of the created record or an error message.

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Authorization:** Ensure the user is properly authenticated (e.g., using a Supabase token).
- **Data Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input data to prevent SQL injection attacks and unexpected errors.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Utilize Supabase's RLS mechanism so that users can only access their own data.
- **Format Restrictions:** Ensure that `title`, `description`, `date`, and `amount` meet the specified requirements.

## 7. Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request:** Return an error for invalid input data, along with a description of the issue.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Return an error when the user is not authenticated.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity:** Return an error when domain validation (e.g., date or amount format) fails.
- Logging errors: Implement error logging at the server level or in a dedicated error logging table to facilitate diagnostics.

## 8. Efficiency Considerations

- **Query Optimization:** Utilize indexes on the `user_id` and `date` columns in the `expense` table for faster access.
- **Asynchronous Validation:** Minimize delays by using non-blocking operations for data validation and insertion.
- **Scalability:** Consider database scalability for handling a large number of operations in the future.

## 9. Implementation Steps

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Review the API specification, database resources, and required DTOs/Command Models.
2. **Input Validation:** Implement an input validation mechanism (e.g., using Zod) for `title`, `description`, `date`, and `amount`.
3. **Authorization Implementation:** Integrate with Supabase for token verification and RLS setup.
4. **Business Logic:** Create a service responsible for:
   - Transforming the input data into `CreateExpenseCommand`
   - Verifying the existence and correctness of `category_id` and `source_id` (if provided)
   - Inserting the record into the `expense` table
5. **API Endpoint:** Create a route handler (e.g., in `/app/api/expenses/route.ts`) to handle POST /expenses requests.
6. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests for validation functions and business logic.
   - Integration tests covering the full operation (successful, erroneous input, unauthorized access, etc.).
7. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement error logging and endpoint monitoring.
8. **Deployment and Code Review:** Deploy changes in a test environment, conduct a team code review, and then finalize deployment to production.
